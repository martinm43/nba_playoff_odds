#TO DO
#Change above logic for splitting season to generate a day and month
#Obtain win/loss records using Scoreboard.E/W Standings By Day and write out W/L to 
#ouftile_wins.csv

#Merge this with the Monte_Carlo_Calculations and Monte_Carlo_Simulation script
#Handle differing simulation methods by using vectorized version as estimate
#No reason that a 300 line or so script can't be used to do this
