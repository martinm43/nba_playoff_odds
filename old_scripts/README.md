### Naismith ###
Version 2.9.0
MA Miller

Naismith is a series of scripts designed to:
1. obtain NBA data
2. analyze team ratings/rankings
3. use them to predict results.

New In This Version:
* Previous version of application was heavily disorganized and unclear.
  Experience gained from "stroman" repository will be applied here. Small number
  of well-organized scripts will be used. Therefore the folder structure
  will not resemble previous iterations of this program.

1. OBTAINING NBA DATA
- Initializing schedules each year
- Obtaining data from third party sources (scanning bballref csvs or using a library)

2. ANALYZING NBA DATA
- Calculating point differential, elo ratings, etc. etc.

3. PREDICTING NBA DATA
- Use a modified version of the "stroman" CPP code.
